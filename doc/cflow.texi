@chapter Introduction to cflow
@pindex cflow
@cindex cflow, a description of
     The @command{cflow} utility analyzes a collection of source files
written in @code{C} programming language and outputs a graph charting
dependencies between various functions.

@cindex direct tree defined
@cindex direct graph defined
@cindex reverse graph defined
@cindex reverse tree defined
     The program is able to produce two kind of graphs: direct
and reverse. @dfn{Direct graph} begins with the main function
(@code{main}), and displays recursively all functions called by it.
In contrast, @dfn{reverse graph} is a set of subgraphs, charting for
each function its callers, in the reverse order. Due to their
tree-like appearance, graphs can also be called @dfn{trees}.  

     In addition to these two output modes, @command{cflow} is able to
produce a @dfn{cross-reference} listing of all the symbols encountered
in the input files.

     The utility also provides a detailed control over symbols that will
appear in its output, allowing to omit those that are of no interest
to the user. The exact appearance of the output graphs is also
configurable.

@FIXME{Some notes about when the user might need the utility? For
example, to get a quick acquaintance with the program, etc.}

@FIXME{The utility should also be able to process following input file
formats: @command{yacc} and @command{lex} sources, and object
files. It is a good idea to add a node @samp{POSIX} discussing this.}

@node Quick Start, Direct and Reverse, Intro, Top
@chapter Simple Ways to Analyze Programs with @command{cflow}.
     Let's begin our acquaintance with the GNU @command{cflow} utility
with an example. Suppose you have a simple implementation of
@command{whoami} command and you wish to obtain a graph of function
dependencies. Here is the program:

@smallexample
@verbatiminclude whoami.c
@end smallexample

     Running @command{cflow} produces the following output:

@cindex GNU Output Format, an example
@smallexample
@group
$ @kbd{cflow whoami.c}
main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>:
    fprintf()
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
        getpwuid()
        geteuid()
        getenv()
        fprintf()
        printf()
@end group
@end smallexample

@cindex GNU Output Format described
@anchor{GNU Output Format}
     This is a direct call graph showing @dfn{caller---callee} dependencies
in the input file. Each line starts with a function name, followed by
a pair of parentheses to indicate that it is a function. If this
function is defined in one of the input files, the line continues by
displaying, within a pair of angle brackets, a function
@dfn{signature} and the location of its definition. If the function
calls another functions, the line ends with a colon. For example, the
line

@smallexample
main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:25>:
@end smallexample

@noindent
shows that function @code{main} is defined in file @file{whoami.c}
at line 25, as @code{int main (int argc, char **argv)}. Terminating
colon indicates that @code{main} invokes other functions.

     The lines following this one show which functions are called by
@code{main}. Each such line is indented by fixed amount of white space
(by default four spaces) for each nesting level.

@cindex @option{--omit-symbol-names} option introduced
@cindex @option{--omit-arguments} option introduced
@anchor{omit signature parts}
     Usually @command{cflow} prints a full function signature. However,
sometimes you may wish to omit some part of it. Several options are
provided for this purpose. To print signatures without function names,
use @option{--omit-symbol-names} option. To omit argument list, use
@option{--omit-arguments}. These options can be needed for a variety
of reasons, one of them being to make the resulting graph more
compact. To illustrate their effect, here is how would the first line of the
above graph look if you had used both @option{--omit-} options:

@smallexample
main() <int () at whoami.c:25>:
@end smallexample

@cindex start symbol
@cindex @option{--main} command line option introduced
@cindex @option{-m} command line option introduced
@anchor{start symbol}
     By default, @command{cflow} starts outputting direct graph from
the function called @code{main}. It is convenient when analyzing a set
of input files comprising an entire @code{C} program. However, there
are circumstances where a user would want to see only a part of
the graph starting on particular function. @command{Cflow}
allows to select such function using @option{--main} (@option{-m})
command line option. Thus, running

@smallexample
cflow --main who_am_i whoami.c
@end smallexample

@noindent
on the above file will produce following graph:

@smallexample
@group
who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
    getpwuid()
    geteuid()
    getenv()
    fprintf()
    printf()
@end group
@end smallexample

@chapter Two Types of Flow Graphs.
@cindex @option{--reverse}
@cindex @option{-r}
     In the previous chapter we have discussed @dfn{direct graphs},
displaying @i{caller---callee} dependencies. Another type of
@command{cflow} output, called @dfn{reverse graph}, charts
@dfn{callee---caller} dependencies. To produce a reverse graph, run
@command{cflow} with @option{--reverse} (@option{-r}) command line
option. For example, using a sample @file{whoami.c}:

@cindex reverse graph, example
@cindex reverse tree, example
@smallexample
@group
$ @kbd{cflow --reverse whoami.c}
fprintf():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
        main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
    main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
getenv():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
        main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
geteuid():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
        main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
getpwuid():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
        main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
printf():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
        main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
    main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
@end group    
@end smallexample

     This output consists of several subgraphs, each describing callers
for a particular function. Thus, the first subgraph tells that the
function @code{fprintf} is called from two functions: @code{who_am_i}
and @code{main}. First of them is, in turn, also called directly by
@code{main}.

@cindex @option{--brief} command line option introduced
@cindex @option{-b} command line option introduced
@anchor{--brief}
     The first thing that draws attention in the above output is that
the subgraph starting with @code{who_am_i} function is repeated several
times. This is @dfn{verbose} output. To make it brief, use
@option{--brief} (@option{-b}) command line option. For example:

@cindex brief output, an example of
@smallexample
@group
$ @kbd{cflow --brief --reverse whoami.c}
fprintf():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
        main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
    main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26> [see 3]
getenv():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
geteuid():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
getpwuid():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26> [see 3]
printf():
    who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
@end group
@end smallexample

@cindex brief output described
     In brief output, once a subgraph for a given function is written,
subsequent instances of calls to that function contain only its
definition and the @dfn{reference} to the output line where the
expanded subgraph can be found.

@cindex @option{--number} command line option introduced
@cindex @option{-n} command line option introduced
@anchor{--number}
     If the output graph is large it can be tedious to find out the
required line number (unless you use @dfn{Emacs cflow-mode},
@pxref{Emacs}). For such cases a special option
@option{--number} (@option{-n}) is provided, which makes
@command{cflow} begin each line of the output with a @dfn{reference
number}, that is the ordinal number of this line in the output. With
this option, the above output will look like:

@smallexample
$ @kbd{cflow --number --brief --reverse whoami.c}
@group
    1 fprintf():
    2     who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>:
    3         main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26>
    4     main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26> [see 3]
    5 getenv():
    6     who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
    7 geteuid():
    8     who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
    9 getpwuid():
   10     who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
   11 main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at whoami.c:26> [see 3]
   12 printf():
   13     who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
   14 who_am_i() <int who_am_i (void) at whoami.c:8>: [see 2]
@end group
@end smallexample

     Of course, @option{--brief} and @option{--number} options
take effect for both direct and reverse flow graphs.

@node Output Formats, Recursive Calls, Direct and Reverse, Top
@chapter Various Output Formats.
@cindex POSIX Output described
@anchor{POSIX Output Format}
     The output format described in previous chapters is called
@dfn{GNU Output}. Beside this, @command{cflow} is also
able to produce output format defined in POSIX standard
(@url{http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/cflow.html,The
Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6: cflow utility}).
In this format, each line of output
begins with a @dfn{reference number}, i.e. the ordinal number of this
line in the output, followed by indentation of fixed amount of columns
per level (@pxref{setting indentation}). Following this are the
name of the function, a colon and the function definition, if
available. The function definition is followed by the location of the
definition (file name and line number). Both definition and location
are enclosed in angle brackets. If the function definition is not
found, the line ends with an empty pair of angle brackets.

@cindex @option{--format=posix}
@cindex @option{-f posix}
@vindex POSIXLY_CORRECT
@cindex POSIX Output Format, generating
     This output format is used when either a command line option
@option{--format=posix} (@option{-f posix}) has been given, or
environment variable @env{POSIXLY_CORRECT} was set.

     The output graph in POSIX format for our sample @file{whoami.c}
file will look as follows:

@smallexample
$ @kbd{cflow --format=posix whoami.c}
    1 main: int (int argc,char **argv), <whoami.c 26>
    2     fprintf: <>
    3     who_am_i: int (void), <whoami.c 8>
    4         getpwuid: <>
    5         geteuid: <>
    6         getenv: <>
    7         fprintf: <>
    8         printf: <>
@end smallexample

     It is not clear from the @acronym{POSIX} specification whether
the output should contain argument lists in function declarations, or
not. By default @command{cflow} will print them. However, some programs,
analyzing @command{cflow} output expect them to be absent. If you use
such a program, add @option{--omit-arguments} option to
@command{cflow} command line (@pxref{omit signature parts}).
     
@FIXME{Discuss the differences and the reason
for existence of each output format. Explain that more formats
will appear in the future.}

     Future versions of @command{cflow} will offer more output
formats, including @acronym{XML} and @acronym{HTML}
outputs. Currently, you can use @command{VCG} tool
(@url{http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/@/users/@/sander/@/html/gsvcg1.html})
to create graphical representation of the produced graphs. To
transform @command{cflow} output to @command{xvcg} input syntax, use
@command{cflow2vcg} program
(@url{http://cflow2vcg.sourceforge.net/}). Both programs are available
under GPL.

@cindex @command{cflow2vcg}, using with @command{cflow}
@cindex @command{xvcg}, using with @command{cflow}
     @command{Cflow2vcg} expects @acronym{POSIX} call graphs, indented
with exactly one horizontal tabulation character per nesting level,
with an additional tab character for zeroth level and without argument
lists in function declaration. So, to produce an output suitable for
@command{cflow2vcg}, invoke @command{cflow} as
follows@footnote{(@xref{ASCII Tree, level-indent}, for the detailed
description of @option{--level-indent} option}:

@smallexample
@group
@kbd{cflow --format=posix --omit-arguments \
      --level-indent='0=\t' --level-indent='1=\t' \
      --level-indent=start='\t'}
@end group
@end smallexample

     You can use the following script to visualize call graphs using
the three tools:

@smallexample
@group
#! /bin/sh

cflow --format=posix --omit-arguments \
      --level-indent='0=\t' --level-indent='1=\t' \
      --level-indent=start='\t' $* |
  cflow2vcg | xvcg -
@end group
@end smallexample

@node Recursive Calls, Symbols, Output Formats, Top
@chapter Handling Recursive Calls.
@cindex Recursive functions
     Sometimes programs contain functions that recursively call
themselves. GNU output format provides a special indication for such
functions. The definition of the recursive function is marked with an
@samp{(R)} at the end of line (before terminating colon). Subsequent
recursive calls to this function are marked with a @samp{(recursive: see
@var{refline})} at the end of line. Here, @var{refline} stands for the
reference line number where the @dfn{recursion root} definition was
displayed.

     To illustrate this, let's consider the following program, that prints 
recursive listing of a directory, allowing to cut off at the arbitrary
nesting level:

@smallexample
@verbatiminclude d.c
@end smallexample

     Running @command{cflow} on this program produces the following graph:

@anchor{sample flowchart}     
@smallexample
$ @kbd{cflow --number d.c}
    1 main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at d.c:85>:
    2     fprintf()
    3     atoi()
    4     printdir() <void printdir (int level,char *name) at d.c:42> (R):
    5         getcwd()
    6         perror()
    7         chdir()
    8         opendir()
    9         readdir()
   10         printf()
   11         ignorent() <int ignorent (char *name) at d.c:28>:
   12             strcmp()
   13         isdir() <int isdir (char *name) at d.c:12>:
   14             stat()
   15             perror()
   16             S_ISDIR()
   17         putchar()
   18         printdir()
                <void printdir (int level,char *name) at d.c:42>
                (recursive: see 4)
   19         closedir()
@end smallexample

     The @code{printdir} description in line 4 shows that the function
is recursive. The recursion call is shown in line 18. 
     
@node Symbols, Preprocessing, Recursive Calls, Top
@chapter Controlling Symbol Types

     An alert reader has already noticed something strange in the
above output: the function @code{_exit} is missing, although according
to the source file it is called twice by @code{printdir}. It is
because by default @command{cflow} omits from its output all symbols
beginning with underscore character. To include these symbols as well,
specify @option{-i _} (or @option{--include _}) command line option.
Continuing our example:

@smallexample
$ @kbd{cflow --number -i _ d.c}
    1 main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at d.c:85>:
    2     fprintf()
    3     atoi()
    4     printdir() <void printdir (int level,char *name) at d.c:42> (R):
    5         getcwd()
    6         perror()
    7         _exit()
    8         chdir()
    9         opendir()
   10         readdir()
   11         printf()
   12         ignorent() <int ignorent (char *name) at d.c:28>:
   13             strcmp()
   14         isdir() <int isdir (char *name) at d.c:12>:
   15             stat()
   16             perror()
   17             S_ISDIR()
   18         putchar()
   19         printdir()
                <void printdir (int level,char *name) at d.c:42>
                (recursive: see 4)
   20         closedir()
@end smallexample

@cindex @option{-i} introduced
@cindex @option{--include} introduced
@cindex Symbol classes defined
@anchor{--include}
     In general, @option{--include} takes an argument specifying a
list of @dfn{symbol classes}. Default option behavior is to include
the requested classes to the output. If the argument begins with a
minus or caret sign, this behavior is reversed and the requested
symbol classes are excluded from the output.

@cindex Including symbols that begin with an underscore
@cindex Excluding symbol classes
     The symbol class @samp{_} includes symbols whose names begin with an
underscore. Another useful symbol class is @samp{s}, representing
@dfn{static functions or data}. By default, static functions are
always included in the output. To omit them, one can give
@option{-i ^s} (or @option{-i -s}@footnote{Notice that @option{-i -s}
is a single option, in spite of @code{-s} beginning with a minus sign.
Since this might be confusing, we prefer using @samp{^} instead of
@samp{-} to denote symbol exclusion.}) 
command line option. Our sample program @file{d.c} defines static
function @code{isdir}, running @command{cflow -i ^s}, completely omits
this function and its callees from the resulting graph:

@smallexample
$ @kbd{cflow --number -i ^s d.c}
    1 main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at d.c:85>:
    2     fprintf()
    3     atoi()
    4     printdir() <void printdir (int level,char *name) at d.c:42> (R):
    5         getcwd()
    6         perror()
    7         chdir()
    8         opendir()
    9         readdir()
   10         printf()
   11         ignorent() <int ignorent (char *name) at d.c:28>:
   12             strcmp()
   13         putchar()
   14         printdir()
                <void printdir (int level,char *name) at d.c:42>
                (recursive: see 4)
   15         closedir()
@end smallexample

     Actually, the exclusion sign (@samp{^} or @samp{-}) can be used
any place in @option{-i} argument, not only at the beginning. Thus,
option @option{-i _^s} means ``@i{include symbols, beginning with
underscore and exclude static functions}''. Several @option{-i} options
accumulate, so the previous example can also be written as
@option{-i _ -i ^s}.

     It is important to notice that by default @command{cflow} graphs
contain only functions. You can, however, request displaying variables
as well, by using symbol class @samp{x}. This class contains all @dfn{data
symbols}, both global and static, so to include these in the output,
use option @option{-i x}. For example:

@anchor{x flowchart}
@smallexample
$ @kbd{cflow --number -i x d.c}
    1 main() <int main (int argc,char **argv) at d.c:85>:
    2     fprintf()
    3     stderr
    4     max_level <int max_level at d.c:37>
    5     atoi()
    6     printdir() <void printdir (int level,char *name) at d.c:42> (R):
    7         DIR
    8         dir

@end smallexample

     Now, lines 3, 4, 16 and 23 show data symbols, with their
definitions when available. Notice, however, lines 7 and 8. Why both
type name @code{DIR} and automatic variable @code{dir} are listed as
data? 

     To answer this question, let's first describe the @command{cflow}
notion of symbols. The program keeps its @dfn{symbol tables}, which
are initially filled with @code{C} predefined keywords. When parsing
input files, @command{cflow} updates these tables. In particular, upon
encountering a @code{typedef}, it registers the defined symbol as a
@dfn{type}.

     Now, @code{DIR} is not declared in @file{d.c}, so @command{cflow}
has no way of knowing it is a data type. So, it supposes it is a
variable. But then the input: 

@smallexample
  DIR *dir;
@end smallexample

@noindent
is parsed as an @emph{expression}, meaning ``multiply @code{DIR} by
@code{dir}''.

     Of course, it is wrong. There are two ways to help
@command{cflow} out of this confusion. You can either explicitly
declare @code{DIR} as data type, or let @command{cflow} run
preprocessor, so it sees the contents of the include files and
determines it by itself. Running preprocessor is covered by the next
chapter (@pxref{Preprocessing}). In the present chapter we will
concentrate on the first method. 

@cindex @option{-s} introduced
@cindex @option{--symbol} introduced
@anchor{--symbol}
     Command line option @option{--symbol} (@option{-s}) declares a
type of the symbol. Its argument consists of two strings separated by
a colon:

@smallexample
  --symbol @var{sym}:@var{t}
@end smallexample

@noindent
The first string, @var{sym} is a @code{C} identifier to be recorded in
the symbol table. The second string, @var{t}, specifies a type to
be associated with this symbol. If @var{t} is a string @samp{type},
the symbol @var{sym} will be recorded as a @code{C} type
definition. Thus, to fix the above output, run:

@smallexample
$ @kbd{cflow --number -i x --symbol DIR:type d.c}
@end smallexample

@cindex Parameter wrapper defined
@cindex @code{__P}, special handling using @option{--symbol}
     Another important symbol type is a @dfn{parameter wrapper}. It is
a kind of a macro, often used in sources that are meant to be
compatible with pre-@acronym{ANSI} compilers to protect parameter
declarations in function prototypes. For example, in the declaration
below, taken from @file{/usr/include/resolv.h}, @code{__P} is a
parameter wrapper: 

@smallexample
void res_npquery __P((const res_state, const u_char *, int, FILE *));
@end smallexample

     For @command{cflow} to be able to process such declarations,
declare @code{__P} as a wrapper, for example:

@smallexample
cflow --symbol __P:wrapper *.c
@end smallexample

@cindex @code{__attribute__}, special handling using @option{--symbol}
     Another usage for @code{wrapper} symbol type is to declare
special @dfn{attributes} often used with @command{gcc}. For example,
the following declaration:

@smallexample
void fatal_exit (void) __attribute__ ((noreturn));
@end smallexample

@noindent
will confuse @command{cflow}. To correctly process it, use option
@option{--symbol __attribute__:wrapper}.

     For the complete list of @option{--symbol} supported types,
@xref{symbol types}.

     Notice, finally, that when using @dfn{preprocess mode}, there is
no need to use @option{--symbol}, since in this mode @command{cflow}
is able to correctly determine all symbol types by itself.

@node Preprocessing, ASCII Tree, Symbols, Top
@chapter Running Preprocessor
@cindex Preprocess mode introduced
@cindex Running preprocessor
@cindex @option{--cpp} option introduced
@cindex @option{--preprocess} option introduced
     @command{Cflow} can preprocess input files before analyzing them,
the same way @command{cc} does before compiling. Doing so allows
@command{cflow} to correctly process all symbol declarations, thus
avoiding the necessity to define special symbols using
@option{--symbol} option, described in the previous chapter. To enable
preprocessing, run the utility with @option{--cpp}
(@option{--preprocess}) command line option. For our sample file
@file{d.c}, this mode gives:

@cindex @option{--cpp} option, an example
@cindex @option{--preprocess} option, an example

@end smallexample

     Compare this graph with the one obtained without @option{--cpp}
option (@pxref{sample flowchart}). As you see, the reference to
@code{S_ISDIR} is gone: the macro has been expanded. Now, try
running @code{cflow --cpp --number -i x d.c} and compare the result
with the graph obtained without preprocessing (@pxref{x
flowchart}). You will see that it produces correct results without
using @option{--symbol} option.

@FIXME{To preprocess or not to preprocess?}

@cindex Default preprocessor command
@cindex Preprocessor command, overriding the default
     By default @option{--cpp} runs @file{/usr/bin/cpp}. If you wish
to run another preprocessor command, specify it as an argument to the
option, after an equal sign. For example, @command{cflow --cpp='cc
-E'} will run the @code{C} compiler as a preprocessor.

@node ASCII Tree, Cross-References, Preprocessing, Top
@chapter Using ASCII Art to Produce Flow Graphs.
@cindex @option{--level-indent} option introduced.
@cindex output indentation level, configuring
@cindex configuring output indentation level
@anchor{setting indentation}
     You can configure the exact appearance of @command{cflow}
output flow graph using @option{--level-indent} option. The simplest
use for this option is to change the default indentation per nesting
level. To do so, give the option a numeric argument specifying the
number of columns to indent for each nesting level. For example, the
following command sets the indentation level to 2, which is half of
the default:

@smallexample
cflow --level-indent 2 d.c
@end smallexample

@noindent
It can be used, for instance, to keep the graph within the page
margins.

     However, @option{--level-indent} can do much more than that. Each
line in the flow graph consists of the following graphical elements: a
@dfn{start marker}, an @dfn{end marker}, with several @dfn{indent fills}
between them. By default, both start and end markers are empty, and
each indent fill contains four spaces. 

     If the argument to @option{--level-indent} option has the form
@var{element}=@var{string}, it specifies a character string that
should be output in place of a given graph element. The element names
are:

@cindex @option{--level-indent} keywords
@vindex start, @option{--level-indent} keyword
@vindex 0, @option{--level-indent} keyword
@vindex 1, @option{--level-indent} keyword
@vindex end0, @option{--level-indent} keyword
@vindex end1, @option{--level-indent} keyword
@multitable @columnfractions 0.2 0.8
@item start @tab Start marker
@item 0     @tab Indent fill 0
@item 1     @tab Indent fill 1
@item end0  @tab End marker 0
@item end1  @tab End marker 1
@end multitable

     Why are there two kinds of indent fills and end markers? Remember
that the flow graph represents a call tree, so it contains terminal
nodes (@dfn{leaves}), i.e. the calls that end a function, and
non-terminal nodes (the calls followed by another ones on the same
nesting level). The @dfn{end marker 0} is for non-terminal nodes, and
@dfn{end marker 1} is for terminal nodes.

     As for indent fills, @dfn{indent fill 1} is used to represent
graph edge, whereas @dfn{fill 0} is used to keep the output properly
aligned.

     To demonstrate this, let's consider following sample program:

@smallexample
@group
@verbatiminclude foo.c
@end group
@end smallexample

@noindent
Now, let's represent line elements by the following strings:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.2 0.8
@item start @tab @samp{::}
@item 0     @tab @samp{  } (two spaces)
@item 1     @tab @samp{| } (a vertical bar and a space)
@item end0  @tab @samp{+-}
@item end1  @tab @samp{\-}
@end multitable

@cindex @option{--level-indent} string syntax
     The corresponding command line will be: @code{cflow --level
begin=:: --level '0=  ' --level '1=| ' --level end0='+-' --level
end1='\\-' foo.c}. Notice escaping the backslash characters in
@code{end1}: generally speaking, @var{string} in
@option{--level-option} can contain usual @code{C} escape sequences,
so the backslash character itself must be escaped. Another shortcut,
allowed in @var{string} is the notation @code{@var{C}x@var{N}}, where
@var{C} is any single character and @var{N} is a decimal number. This
notation means ``@i{repeat character @var{C} @var{N}
times}''. However, character @samp{x} looses its special meaning if
used at the beginning of the string.

     This command will produce the following output:

@smallexample
@group
::+-main() <int main () at foo.c:3>:
::  +-f() <int f () at foo.c:11>:
::  | \-h()
::  \-g()
@end group
@end smallexample

@cindex @option{--tree} introduced
@cindex @option{-T} introduced
     Thus, we obtained an @dfn{ASCII art} representation of the call
tree. GNU @command{cflow} provides a special option @option{--tree}
(@option{-T}), which is a shortcut for @code{--level '0=  ' --level
'1=| ' --level end0='+-' --level end1='\\-'}. The following is an
example of flow graph produced with this option. The source file
@file{wc.c} is a simple implementation of UNIX @command{wc} command,
@xref{Source of wc command}.

@chapter Cross-Reference Output.
@cindex Cross-References introduced
@cindex @option{--xref} option introduced
@cindex @option{-x} option introduced
     GNU @command{cflow} is also able to produce @dfn{cross-reference
listings}. This mode is enabled by @option{--xref} (@option{-x})
command line option. Cross-reference output lists each symbol
occurrence on a separate line. Each line shows the identifier and the
source location where it appears. If this location is where the symbol
is defined, it is additionally marked with an asterisk and followed by
the definition. For example, here is a fragment of cross-reference
output for @file{d.c} program:

@smallexample
printdir * d.c:42 void printdir (int level,char *name)
printdir   d.c:74
printdir   d.c:102
@end smallexample

     It shows that the function @code{printdir} is defined in line 42
and referenced twice, in lines 74 and 102.

     The symbols included in cross-reference listings are controlled
by @option{--include} option (@pxref{--include}). In addition to
character classes discussed in chapter ``Controlling Symbol Types''
(@pxref{Symbols}), an additional symbol class @code{t} controls
listing of type names defined by @code{typedef} keyword.

@node Configuration, Makefiles, Cross-References, Top
@chapter Configuration Files and Variables.
     As shown in the previous chapters, GNU @command{cflow} is highly
configurable. Different command line options have different effects,
as specifying new operation modes or altering some aspects of the
output. You will likely use some options frequently, while you will
use others from time to time, or not at all (@xref{Options}, for a
full list of options).

@vindex CFLOW_OPTIONS
@cindex @file{.profile}
     The @env{CFLOW_OPTIONS} environment variable specifies default
options to be placed in front of any explicit options. For example,
if you set @code{CFLOW_OPTIONS="--format=posix --cpp"} in your
@file{.profile}, @command{cflow} will behave as if the two options
@option{--format=posix} and @option{--cpp} had been specified before
any explicit options.

@cindex Configuration file
@vindex CFLOWRC
@cindex @file{.cflowrc}
     There is also another possibility to specify your default
options. After incorporating eventual content of @env{CFLOW_OPTIONS}
variable, @command{cflow} checks the value of the environment variable
@env{CFLOWRC}. This value, if not empty, specifies the name of
the @dfn{configuration file} to read. If @env{CFLOWRC} is not defined or
is empty, the program attempts to read file @file{.cflowrc} in the
user's home directory. It is not an error if any of these
files does not exist. However, if the file does exist but cannot be
processed, @command{cflow} will issue an explicit error message.

@cindex Configuration file format
     The configuration file is read line by line. Empty lines and
lines beginning with usual @command{shell} comment character
(@samp{#}) are ignored. Otherwise, the line is split into @dfn{words},
the same way @command{shell} does, and the resulting words are
placed in the command line after any options taken from
@env{CFLOW_OPTIONS} variable, but before any explicit options.

     Pay attention when using such options as @option{-D} in the
configuration file. The value of @option{-D} option will be added to
the preprocessor command line and will be processed by the shell, so
be careful to properly quote its argument. The rule of thumb is:
``@i{use the same quoting you would have used in the shell command line}''.
For example, to run @command{cc -E} as a preprocessor, you can use the
following configuration file:

@smallexample
@group
--symbol __const:type
--symbol __restrict:type
--cpp='cc -E'
-D__extension__=
-D__attribute__\\\(c\\\)=
-D__asm__\\\(c\\\)=
@end group
@end smallexample

@cindex Option cancellation
     It may sometimes be necessary to cancel the effect of a command
line option. For example, you might specify @option{--brief} in your
configuration file, but then occasionally need to obtain verbose
graph. To cancel effect of any GNU @command{cflow} option that does
not take arguments, prepend @samp{no-} to the corresponding long
option name. Thus, specifying @option{--no-brief} cancels the effect
of the previous @option{--brief} option.

@node Makefiles, Options, Configuration, Top
@chapter Using @command{cflow} in Makefiles.
@cindex @file{Makefile.am}
     If you wish to use @command{cflow} to analyze your project
sources, @file{Makefile} or @file{Makefile.am} is the right place to
do so. In this chapter we will describe a generic rule for
@file{Makefile.am}. If you do not use @command{automake}, you can
deduce the rule for plain @file{Makefile} from this one.

     Here is a check list of steps to do to set up a @file{Makefile.am}
framework:

@itemize @minus
@item If you use a configuration file, add it to @code{EXTRA_DIST}
variable.

@item Add variable @code{CFLOW_FLAGS} with any special @command{cflow}
options you wish to use. The variable can be empty, its main purpose
is making it possible to override @command{cflow} options by running
@command{make CFLOW_FLAGS=@dots{} chart}.

@item For each @var{program} from your @code{@var{dir}_PROGRAMS} list,
for which you want to generate a flow chart, add the following statements:

@smallexample
@group
@var{program}_CFLOW_INPUT=$(@var{program}_OBJECTS:.$(OBJEXT)=.c)
@var{program}.cflow: @var{program}_CFLOW_INPUT cflow.rc Makefile
	CFLOWRC=@var{path-to-your-cflow.rc} \
	 cflow -o$@@ $(CFLOW_FLAGS) $(DEFS) \
                    $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) $(AM_CPPFLAGS) \
	            $(CPPFLAGS) \
         $(@var{program}_CFLOW_INPUT)
@end group
@end smallexample

@noindent
Replace @var{program} with program name and
@var{path-to-your-cflow.rc} with the full file name of your
@file{cflow.rc} file (if any). If you do not wish to use
preprocessing, remove from the @command{cflow} command line all
variables, except @code{CFLOW_FLAGS}.

@item If there are several programs built by this @file{Makefile.am},
you may wish to add a special rule, allowing to create all flow charts
with a single command, for example:

@smallexample
flowcharts: @var{prog1}.cflow @var{prog2}.cflow ...
@end smallexample
@end itemize

     As an example, here are the relevant statements which we use in
@command{cflow} @file{src/Makefile.am}:

@smallexample
@group

CFLOW_FLAGS=-i^s
cflow_CFLOW_INPUT=$(cflow_OBJECTS:.$(OBJEXT)=.c)

references to more in-depth explanations in the body of the
manual. Both short and long option forms are listed, so you can use
this table as a quick reference.

     Most of the options have a @dfn{negation counterpart}, an option
with a reverse meaning. The name of a negation option is formed by
prefixing the corresponding long option name with a @option{no-}. This
feature is provided to cancel default options specified in the

     Set initial token stack size to @var{number} tokens. Default is
64. The token stack grows automatically when it needs to accommodate
more tokens than its current size, so it is seldom necessary to
use this option. 

@cindex @option{--preprocess}

     Define symbol @var{sym} as having type @var{type}. Valid types
are: @samp{keyword} (or @samp{kw}), @samp{modifier},
@samp{identifier}, @samp{type}, @samp{wrapper}. Any unambiguous
abbreviation of the above is also accepted. @xref{--symbol}.

     @bullet{} Use source file indentation as a hint. Currently this means that
the closing curly brace (@samp{@}}) in the column zero forces

sparingly, it may cause misinterpretation of some sources.

@cindex @option{-U}
@cindex @option{--undefine}

@item -v
@itemx --verbose
     @bullet{} Verbosely list any errors encountered in the input files. The
@command{cflow} notion of an error does not match that of @code{C}
compiler, so by default error messages are turned off. It is useful to
enable them if you suspect that @command{cflow} misinterprets the
sources.

@cindex @option{-V}
@cindex @option{--version}
@item -V

@chapter Using @command{cflow} with GNU Emacs.
@cindex cflow-mode introduced
@cindex Emacs
     GNU @command{cflow} comes with an @command{emacs} module
providing a major mode for visiting flow charts in GNU Emacs. If you
have a working @command{emacs} on your machine, the module will be
installed somewhere in your Emacs @code{load-path}. To load the module
at startup, add the following lines to your @file{.emacs} or
@file{site-start.el} file:

@smalllisp
@group
(autoload 'cflow-mode "cflow-mode")
(setq auto-mode-alist (append auto-mode-alist
                              '(("\\.cflow$" . cflow-mode))))
@end group
@end smalllisp

@noindent
@cindex @option{--emacs} introduced
@anchor{--emacs}
The second statement associates @code{cflow-mode} with any file having
suffix @file{.cflow}. If you prefer to have another suffix for flow
graph files, use it instead. You can also omit this option, if you do
not use any special suffix for your graph files. In this case we
recommend using @option{--emacs} command line option. This option
generates the first line telling Emacs to use @code{cflow} major mode
when visiting the file.

     The buffer opened in @code{cflow} mode is made read-only. The
following key bindings are defined:

@table @key
@item E
     Temporarily exits from @code{cflow} mode and allows you to edit
the graph file. To resume @code{cflow} mode type @key{M-x} cflow-mode
@key{RET}. This option is provided mainly for debugging
purposes. We do not recommend you to edit chart files, since this
will change line numbering and thus prevent @code{cflow} mode from
correctly tracing line references.

@item x
     Go to expansion of the current graph vertex. Use this key if the
point stands on a line ending with @samp{[see @var{N}]} reference. It
will bring you directly to the referenced line. Use
@code{exchange-point-and-mark} (by default @key{C-x C-x}) to return to
the line you examined.

@item R
     If the point is standing on a recursive function, go to the next
recursion. Sets mark.

@item r
     If the point is standing on a recursive function, return to its
definition (a @dfn{recursion root}). Sets mark.

@item s
     Visit the referenced source file and find the function definition.
