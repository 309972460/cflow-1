Copyright (C) 2005, Sergey Poznyakoff

* Introduction

This document specifies the roadmap for converting cflow into a
package conforming to GNU standards and providing full functionality
of POSIX cflow utility plus useful extensions. It is subdivided into
three main sections: High Priority Issues, Medium Priority Issues and
Low Priority Issues. The entries within each section are placed in
order of decreasing priority, the most urgent ones being the first.

* High Priority Issues

** Implement `-i x' option

** Divide and conquer: separate main cflow code (/src) and C lexical analizer
(/back-ends/C)

** Write proper documentation

* Medium Priority Issues

** Handle #line statements in input files.

** Optionally preprocess input files with cpp.

** Implement front-end support.

** Provide front ends for: ASCII tree representation (~ current output look),
XML/HTML output.

** Update and debug Emacs interface (cflow.el)

* Low Priority Issues

** Internationalization

** Add new back-ends: C++, Scheme, Lisp...
