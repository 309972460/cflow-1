These notes intend to help people working on the CVS version of
this package.

* Requirements

Only the sources are installed in the CVS repository (to ease the
maintenance, merges etc.), therefore you will have to get the latest
stable versions of the maintainer tools we depend upon, including:

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Flex <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Gnulib <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>
- Wget <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful,
later, a plain `cvs update -P && make' should be sufficient.

* First CVS checkout

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
this package from CVS.  The next step is to get other files needed to
build, which are extracted from other source packages:

	$ build-aux/bootstrap

If you already have checked out the gnulib sources, you can speed up
the process by specifying their location using --gnulib-srcdir command
line option:

        $ build-aux/bootstrap --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnu/gnulib

If you plan to be hacking on cflow, it is probably that you will need
to re-run bootstrap from time to time, for example after updating your
gnulib copy in order to propagate the changes into cflow tree.  In
these case we recommend to store bootstrap options in a file named
.bootstrap, in the cflow root directory.  The format of this file is
very simple: it contains bootstrap command line options separated by
any amount of whitespace characters (i.e. spaces, tabs and newlines).
Any line starting with a comment character `#' is ignored as well as
are empty lines.  For example, if you plan to always use the same gnulib
directory and to copy gnulib files instead of creating symbolic links
to them, then your .bootstrap file would contain:

       # Sample .bootstrap file
       --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnu/gnulib
       --copy

Once you have bootstrapped the source tree, run:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check

Enjoy!
