* Introduction

This stuff was initially written in 1997, when I needed a utility
that could display the control flow in a C program. The latest updates
date back to 1999. Then, as I no longer needed the package, it fell into
oblivion.

A recent thread in gnu-devel mailing list has shown that there is a
kind of demand for that sort of utility, so I decided to resurrect
it and make a full-fledged package of it. See TODO for the details.

* Current Status

The contents of src/ directory compiles and runs on GNU/Linux systems.
Emacs module cflow.el is known to work with Emacs 20.1

* Planned Status

The planned utility shall fully conform to POSIX specification of a
cflow utility. See doc/cflow.txt for the exact description.

The package shall have modular architecture: the `cflow' utility itself
shall invoke an external program (a back-end) to perform a lexical analisys
of input sources. This will allow to use `cflow' to analize source files
written in languages other than C.

The output format of the utility shall conform to the POSIX specification.
The program shall also be able to optionally pipe its output to an
external program (a front-end). This will allow for creating reports in
various formats (e.g. graph, html, etc.)

An Emacs interface shall be provided that will facilitate source file
navigation from Emacs.
