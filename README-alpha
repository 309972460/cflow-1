This is the GNU cflow package.
This document describes the actions needed to build the pre-release
or CVS version of the package. See end of file for copying conditions.

* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use yet. If you
are taking source from CVS, you will need to have automake, and
autoconf installed to bootstrap the package. See the chapter `Building' for
the detailed instructions. After bootstrapping, there should be a file
'INSTALL' with generic installation instructions. Package-specific
installation instructions are set forth in the file README.

Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate or
incomplete (well, to say the truth it is absent. See TODO for more info).
The ChangeLog file is the authoritative documentation for all recent changes.

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the CVS repository:

To checkout the source tree from CVS issue the following command:

CVS_RSH=ssh \
 cvs -d :ext:anoncvs@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/cflow checkout cflow

Make sure SSHv2 is used.

This will give you read-only access.  If you think you need write access,
contact the mailing list.

The CVS repository is also available via HTTP from

    http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/cflow/cflow/
    
* Building

If you have taken the sources from CVS you will need the following
packages to build cflow.  I don't make any extra effort to accommodate
older versions of these packages, so please make sure that you have the
latest stable version.

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Flex <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Gnulib <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>
- Wget <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>

To prepare the package for building run `build-aux/bootstrap' utility.
For example: 

 $ cd cflow
 $ build-aux/bootstrap

If you have already checked out gnulib sources, use --gnulib-srcdir
to specify their location, this will spare you time and bandwidth:

 $ cd cflow
 $ build-aux/bootstrap --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnu/gnulib
 
* Debugging

To enable additional debugging information, configure the package with
--enable-debug option.

Sometimes it is impossible or inconvenient to start cflow from the
debugger. In this case, use --HANG option. The option instructs the
program to sleep for a given number of seconds (3600 by default)
right after startup. For example, run:

	cflow --HANG [OTHER-OPTIONS]

Then switch to another terminal, get the PID of the ivoked utility
and attach to it using gdb:

	gdb cflow PID

Once in gdb, issue the following command

	set _argp_hang=0

Now set your breakpoints and proceed as usual.
